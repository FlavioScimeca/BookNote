# Built-in modules in Node.js

Built-in modules in Node.js refer to a set of core modules that are included with the Node.js runtime environment. These modules provide a range of functionalities and APIs to perform various tasks without the need for external dependencies or additional installations. They are readily available for use in Node.js applications without requiring any specific installation steps.

Here are some commonly used built-in modules in Node.js:

1. **fs** (File System): The fs module allows you to work with the file system, enabling file read/write operations, directory manipulation, file metadata access, and more.

2. **http**: The http module provides functionality for creating HTTP servers and making HTTP requests. It allows you to handle HTTP requests, send responses, and perform client-side HTTP operations.

3. **https**: The https module is similar to the http module but specifically designed for creating HTTPS servers and making secure HTTPS requests over SSL/TLS.

4. **path**: The path module provides utilities for working with file paths. It offers functions to manipulate file and directory paths, resolve relative paths, extract file extensions, and more. This module is useful for handling file system paths in a cross-platform manner.

5. **events**: The events module is an event emitter module that allows you to implement and handle custom events in your applications. It provides an event-driven programming paradigm and enables communication between different parts of your codebase.

6. **util**: The util module contains various utility functions that are helpful for working with JavaScript objects and performing common operations. It includes functions for inheritance, debugging, error handling, and more.

7. **querystring**: The querystring module provides functions for parsing and formatting URL query strings. It allows you to encode and decode query parameters, stringify JavaScript objects into query strings, and parse query strings into JavaScript objects.

8. **crypto**: The crypto module provides cryptographic functionality for generating hashes, encrypting and decrypting data, creating digital signatures, and performing other cryptographic operations.

9. **os**: The os module provides information and utilities related to the operating system. It allows you to access information about the current system, such as CPU architecture, memory, network interfaces, and more.

10. **stream**: The stream module enables you to work with streams of data, which can be used for efficient handling of large amounts of data or for processing data incrementally. It provides a set of classes and functions for working with readable streams, writable streams, and transform streams.
