# App.delete()

In Express.js, the `app.delete()` method is used to define a route handler for the HTTP DELETE method. It allows you to handle DELETE requests to a specific URL or route in your application.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `app.delete()` in Express.js:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// DELETE route handler
app.delete('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // Logic to delete the user with the given ID
  // ...
  res.send(`User with ID ${userId} deleted successfully.`);
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, we define a DELETE route using `app.delete()`. The route pattern is `/api/users/:id`, where `:id` is a route parameter representing the ID of the user to be deleted.

When a DELETE request is made to this route, the callback function `(req, res)` is executed. Inside the callback, you can access the `req.params` object to retrieve the value of the `id` parameter from the route.

You can perform the necessary logic to delete the user with the given ID from your data source or database. After that, you can send a response to the client using `res.send()` to indicate the success of the deletion.
