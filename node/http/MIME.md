# MIME types

MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types are a standard way of identifying the nature and format of files or data being transmitted over the internet. They are used to specify the content type of a resource, allowing clients and servers to interpret and handle the data correctly. MIME types consist of two parts: a type and a subtype, separated by a forward slash ("/").

The general structure of a MIME type is as follows: `type/subtype`.

Here's an example of MIME types and their structure in Node.js:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const contentType = 'text/plain'; // Example MIME type

  res.setHeader('Content-Type', contentType);
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, we create an HTTP server using the `http` module. Within the request handler, we set the `Content-Type` header using the `res.setHeader()` method.

- **Example MIME Type**: In the example, we set the `Content-Type` to `'text/plain'`. This MIME type indicates that the response contains plain text data. The `'text'` represents the general category, and `'plain'` represents the subtype indicating plain text specifically.

Other common MIME types include:

- `'text/html'`: Represents HTML documents.
- `'application/json'`: Represents JSON data.
- `'image/jpeg'`: Represents JPEG images.
- `'audio/mp3'`: Represents MP3 audio files.
- `'video/mp4'`: Represents MP4 video files.

By setting the correct MIME type, the client receiving the response can interpret and handle the data appropriately. For example, a web browser would render the response differently depending on whether it receives `'text/html'` or `'image/jpeg'`.

It's important to note that Node.js itself doesn't enforce or restrict the usage of MIME types. The MIME type you set in Node.js is typically used to provide hints to the client or downstream systems about the content type being served. The client or the consuming system decides how to interpret and handle the received data based on the provided MIME type.
